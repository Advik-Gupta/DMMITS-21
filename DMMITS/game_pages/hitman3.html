        <p>Hitman 3 (stylized as HITMAN III) is a 2021 stealth game developed and published by IO Interactive for
            Microsoft Windows, GameStation 4, GameStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Stadia (under the title Hitman:
            World of Assassination), and Nintendo Switch on 20 January 2021. It is the eighth main installment in the
            Hitman series and the final entry in the World of Assassination trilogy, following Hitman (2016) and Hitman
            2 (2018). The single-player story concludes the plot arc started in Hitman, and follows
            genetically-engineered assassin Agent 47 and his allies as they hunt down the leaders of Providence, the
            secretive organization controlling the world's affairs. Hitman 3 received positive reviews from critics.
            Like its predecessors, Hitman 3 is a stealth game played from a third-person perspective and players once
            again assume control of assassin Agent 47. In the game, 47 travels to various locations and carries out
            contracted assassinations, continuing the story of the last two games. The base game features six new
            locations: Dubai, Dartmoor, Berlin, Chongqing, Mendoza and an epilogue set in the Carpathian Mountains,
            Romania. Owners of Hitman or Hitman 2 are able to import maps, levels and their progress into Hitman 3. The
            new locations in Hitman 3 include persistent shortcuts, a new gameplay feature to the series. Each stage
            includes several initially locked doors which can only be unlocked from one side; once unlocked, these doors
            stay open in all future playthroughs, allowing initially closed-off locations to be reached more quickly.<a
