        <p>Devil May Cry 5 is a 2019 action-adventure game developed and published by Capcom. It is the sixth
            installment overall and the fifth mainline installment in the Devil May Cry series. Capcom released it for
            Microsoft Windows, GameStation 4, GameStation 5, and Xbox One on 8 March 2019. The game takes place five years after Devil
            May Cry 4 and follows a trio of warriors with demonic powers: the returning Dante, Nero and a new
            protagonist named V as they attempt to stop the Demon King Urizen from destroying the human world. Across
            their journey in Red Grave City, the player can use these characters in different missions. Each of them has
            their own way of fighting and becoming stronger. As this happens, the mystery behind V is revealed along
            with his connection with Urizen. Devil May Cry 5 was directed by Hideaki Itsuno whose goal was for this
            installment to be his best work. He aimed to make the game balanced for both newcomers and returning gamers
            by providing adequate, difficult and new enemies. Capcom also wanted to bring a more realistic design
            inspired by the RE Engine used in their previous work, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard. As a result, models were
            used to make the character's faces. The plot was written by returning writer Bingo Morihashi while the
            setting was based on various locations in London. Multiple composers worked together to produce the game's
            audio, creating three main themes centered around the playable characters. Devil May Cry 5 received positive
            reviews from critics, praising the variety of techniques the three characters bring, while also liking the
            handling of the narrative. The game won multiple game awards in both 2019 and 2020, sold over two million
            copies less than two weeks after its release, and surpassed three million in a year, becoming the
            top-selling game in the franchise. <a
