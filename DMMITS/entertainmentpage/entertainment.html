           <p>YouTube is an American online video sharing and social media platform launched by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim in February 2005. After Google, YouTube is the most visited website worldwide, with over one billion monthly users. Its users watch more than one billion hours of videos each day, and, as of May 2019, it was estimated that videos were being uploaded at a rate of more than 500 hours of content per minute. In October 2006, YouTube was bought by Google for $1.65 billion. Google's ownership of YouTube has also changed its business model; it no longer generates revenue from advertisements alone. YouTube now offers paid content such as movies and exclusive content. YouTube and approved creators participate in Google's AdSense program, which generates more revenue for both parties. It has since evolved from a small video streaming platform to a large service influencing popular culture, internet trends, and creating multimillionaire celebrities. YouTube reported revenues of $19.8 billion in 2020.<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/">Visit</a></p>
